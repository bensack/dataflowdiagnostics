# Power Automate Dataflow Connector Templates
In this **[POST]** you can read about the new connector to:
* Refresh Power BI and Power Platform based on a trigger
* Trigger an action based on the completion of a dataflow refresh.

In this blog, we are going to discuss some use cases with corresponding templatrs, to quick-start the use of this connector. We are going to discuss the following templates:

Notifications:
* Send an email notification when a dataflow refresh status changes
* Send email notification on succes or failure of a dataflow
* When a dataflow refresh status changes, sends a Teams notification

Support tickets:
* When a dataflow refresh fails, send a message to service bus queue to open a support ticket


Trigger Dataflows/Datasets sequentially
* When you click on button, a dataflow refresh starts
* Shen an analytical dataflow succeeds refreshing, trigger a standard dataflow (power platform)
* When a dataflow refresh succeeds, trigger a power BI dataset
* When a file in SharePoint gets updated, trigger a dataflow

Save dataflow meta-data
* When a dataflow refresh completes, save meta-data to Dataverse Table
* When a dataflow refresh completes, save meta-data to Exel online
* When a dataflow refresh completes, save meta-data to Power BI Streaming dataset

## Notifications
### Use Case
When your dataflow refresh completes, you want to get an email/teams or any other type of nitofication to alert you when your dataflow refresh completes. You can also set alerts based on the refresh status of the dataflow. You could for example only be notified when a dataflow refresh was completed. This way, you know your data is up to date and you can start getting new insights. Another common scenario, is not get notified when a dataflow refresh failed. This way you can idediately start ivestigating the problem and alert people that depend on the data being refreshed.

### Using the templates
For sending notifications, we published three templates:
* Send an email notification when a dataflow refresh status changes
* Send email notification on succes or failure of a dataflow
* When a dataflow refresh status changes, sends a Teams notification

Let's take a look at the second template:
* Navigate to flow.microsoft.com
* Search for the template **Send email notification on succes or failure of a data flow refresh**, by following these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/get-started-logic-template)

* Customize the flow
    Actions that require input from you will automatically be expanded.

   The **Dataflow Refresh** trigger is expanded because you need to enter *Dataflow*. You need to enter the following information:
   * **Group Type**: Choose *Environment* when connection to PowerApps and *Workspace* when connecting to Power BI
    * **Group**: Select the Power Apps environment or the Power BI workspace you dataflow is in
    * **Dataflow**: Select your dataflow by name

After the condition, you can specify what happens after succes or failure of the dataflow. In this template in both cases, we send you an email with the status of the dataflow refresh.

Note: you can modify the email content or flow.

## Support Tickets

### Use Cases
When your dataflow refresh completes, or has been taking longer than expected, you might want to open a support ticket/create a message in a que or service bus, so your support team can take a look at the issue.

### Using the Templates

Let's look at the template where we want to add a message to the queue, when a dataflow refresh failed. In this template, we make use of Azure Service Bus. To create an Azure Service bus an d create a Queue folllow these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quickstart-portal#create-a-namespace-in-the-azure-portal).

* Navigate to flow.microsoft.com
* Search for the template **when a dataflow refresh failes, add a new message to the queue**, by following these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/get-started-logic-template)

* Customize the flow
    Actions that require input from you will automatically be expanded.

   The **Dataflow Refresh** trigger is expanded because you need to enter *Dataflow*. You need to enter the following information:
   * **Group Type**: Choose *Environment* when connection to PowerApps and *Workspace* when connecting to Power BI
    * **Group**: Select the Power Apps environment or the Power BI workspace you dataflow is in
    * **Dataflow**: Select your dataflow by name

After the condition, you can specify what happens after succes or failure of the dataflow. In this template in both cases, we send you an email with the status of the dataflow refresh.

## Trigger Dataflows and Power BI Dataset Sequentially

### Use Cases
There are two very common use cases for how you can use this connector to trigger multiple dataflows and Power BI dataset sequentially.

1. Trigger the refresh of a Standard Dataflow after the succesfull completion of an Analytical Dataflow refresh.

If a dataflow performs all actions, then it is hard to reuse its entities in other dataflows or for other purposes. The best dataflows to reuse are those dataflows doing only a few actions. Creating dataflows that specialize in one specific task is one of the best ways of reusing them. If you have a set of dataflows as staging dataflows, their only action is to extract data "as is" from the source system. These dataflows can be reused in multiple other dataflows. For more information, take a look at the [best practices for reusing datafows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/dataflows/best-practices-reusing-dataflows)


3. Trigger the refresh of a Power BI dataset when a dataflow refresh completed succesfully.

If you want to make sure that your dashboard is directly up-to-date after a dataflow refreshed your data, you can use the connector to trigger the refresh of a Power BI dataset after you dataflow refreshed succesfully.

### Using the Templates

et's take a look at the second template:
* Navigate to flow.microsoft.com
* Search for the template **Trigger a dataflow refresh after my dataflow refresgh completed succesfully**, by following these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/get-started-logic-template)

![An example of folder structure](images/emailyesyno.PNG)

* Customize the flow
    Actions that require input from you will automatically be expanded.

   The **Dataflow Refresh** trigger is expanded because you need to enter *Dataflow*. You need to enter the following information:
   * **Group Type**: Choose *Environment* when connection to PowerApps and *Workspace* when connecting to Power BI
    * **Group**: Select the Power Apps environment or the Power BI workspace you dataflow is in
    * **Dataflow**: Select your dataflow by name

After the condition, you can specify what happens after succes or failure of the dataflow. In this template we trigger a new datafow:

   The **refresg a dataflow** ation is expanded because you need to enter *Dataflow*. You need to enter the following information:
   * **Group Type**: Choose *Environment* when connection to PowerApps and *Workspace* when connecting to Power BI
    * **Group**: Select the Power Apps environment or the Power BI workspace you dataflow is in
    * **Dataflow**: Select your dataflow by name
